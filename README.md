# 📊 Data-Driven Scenario Modeling and Funding Impact Analysis in Startups
### By: **Neelam Pharswan | B.Sc. Data Science, Uttaranchal University (2025)**  


## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes how data analytics can guide **funding decisions for startups** using an integrated approach of **Power BI and Python**.  
Inspired by **Zomato**, the study models how a **$500K funding scenario** impacts startup growth, profitability, and customer retention.  

The project demonstrates how combining **Business Intelligence (Power BI)** and **Data Science (Python)** provides powerful insights into revenue optimization, burn rate reduction, and customer behavior.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Simulate and analyze the **impact of $500K funding** on startup KPIs.  
- Build a **4-page Power BI dashboard** to visualize performance metrics.  
- Integrate **Python analytics** for data cleaning, trend visualization, and KPI validation.  
- Derive actionable insights for **investors, HR professionals, and startup founders** through data storytelling.


## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
| Category | Tools Used |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data Analytics | **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)** |
| Visualization | **Power BI** (DAX, Cards, Charts, Filters) |
| Data Sources | CSV/Excel Simulated Startup Dataset |
| Documentation | Microsoft Word (Research Paper), Power BI Reports |


## 📈 Key Insights
- 📊 **Revenue** increased by **25%** after simulated funding.  
- 💰 **Burn rate** decreased by **17%**, extending the runway by **4.5 months**.  
- 👥 **Customer retention** improved by **18%**, especially in Tier-2 markets.  
- 📉 **Customer acquisition cost (CAC)** reduced by **12%** through optimized marketing spend.  

These results confirm that **data-driven financial planning** strengthens strategic funding decisions and improves investor confidence.


## 🖥️ Dashboard Pages
| Page | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **1️⃣ KPI Overview** | Tracks key metrics like MRR, CAC, LTV, and Profit Growth % |
| **2️⃣ Market Analysis** | Visualizes regional trends, competition, and cuisine performance |
| **3️⃣ Financial Projections** | Displays revenue, expenses, and burn rate before & after funding |
| **4️⃣ Customer Analytics** | Shows retention, demographics, and satisfaction insights |
| **5️⃣ Scenario Modeling** | Simulates $500K funding impact using DAX-driven growth factors |


## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Cleaned and preprocessed raw startup dataset using Python (Pandas).  

2. **KPI Computation:**  
   Created DAX measures in Power BI for Profit Margin %, CAC, LTV, Churn Rate, and Funding Impact.  

3. **Visualization:**  
   Designed interactive dashboards with slicers and cards to explore metrics across time and regions.  

4. **Scenario Simulation:**  
   Modeled the effect of $500K funding on growth using DAX logic and trend projections.  

5. **Validation:**  
   Cross-verified Power BI outcomes using Python visualizations and statistical summaries.
